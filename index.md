## Overview

Johnslists list is a website utilizing semantic ui, react.js, meteor, and mongoDB to create a website that can be used by students to trade common goods. Community members of UH Manoa can add common goods, such as textbooks or appliances, that they no longer need and create listings with details about said item. 

For more information on the techstack used:
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) for Javascript-based implementation of client and server code. 
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) for component-based UI implementation and routing.
* [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) CSS Framework for UI design.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) Backend Database for adding objects 

## Functionality Goals

* Two types of users: Regular and Admin (Both of which log in from the same page, but get directed to different home screens)
* Profiles can be customized to display a picture and a description of the person
* Add listing, edit listing, and view listings usability features (Regular users can only add/edit their own while admins can have functionality for all listings)
* Listings can be filtered depending on what specifically the user is looking for (Ex. textbooks specifically for biology)
* Users can flag or report listings that are not related to what the site's purpose is for to admins.
